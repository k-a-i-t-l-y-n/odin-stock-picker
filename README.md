# odin-stock-picker
This is my solution for the Odin Project's stock picker exercise.

I developed a method that takes an array and returns an array for the best days to buy and sell stock respectively. The days start at zero and are based on the array's index, you only have that week to buy and sell, and you must buy stock before you sell it.

Example
-------
stock_picker [10, 2, 1, 20] => [2, 3]
